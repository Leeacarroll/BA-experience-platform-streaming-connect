# What is Kafka Connect?

"[Kafka Connect](https://docs.confluent.io/current/connect/index.html)", an open source component of Apache Kafka, is a framework for connecting Kafka with external systems such as databases, key-value stores, search indexes, and file systems."

Kafka Connect is basically a set of connectors developed by the open source community around Apache Kafka, that allows developers to get data from their databases directly into Kafka, and then take that data from Kafka and put it into other systems like Elastic Search.
